## 1. Feature Distributions by Diagnosis

![Figure1](images/Figure_1.png)

**Description:**  
- 3x4 grid showing distributions of 12 key clinical features
- Each subplot displays overlapping histograms for malignant (red) and benign (blue) cases
- Features include radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension
- Clear separation between colored distributions indicates feature discriminative power

**Insights:**  
- Worst concave points and perimeter show excellent separation between classes
- Texture and smoothness features show more overlap between malignant and benign
- Malignant cases tend to have larger values for size-related features (radius, perimeter, area)
- Concavity-related features are strong differentiators for cancer detection

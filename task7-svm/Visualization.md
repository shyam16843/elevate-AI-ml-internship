## 1. Feature Distributions by Diagnosis

![Figure1](images/Figure_1.png)

**Description:**  
- 3x4 grid showing distributions of 12 key clinical features from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset
- Each subplot displays overlapping histograms for malignant (red) and benign (blue) cases
- Features include radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension
- Clear separation between colored distributions indicates feature discriminative power

**Insights:**  
- Worst concave points and perimeter show excellent separation between classes
- Texture and smoothness features show more overlap between malignant and benign
- Malignant cases tend to have larger values for size-related features (radius, perimeter, area)
- Concavity-related features are strong differentiators for cancer detection
- Feature scaling is crucial due to varying measurement scales

## 2. Feature Importance from Linear SVM

**Description:**  
- Bar chart ranking top 15 most important features based on absolute coefficient values from Linear SVM
- Features sorted by their contribution to classification decision
- Numerical values displayed on each bar for precise interpretation
- Color gradient indicates relative importance

**Insights:**  
- "Worst concave points" is the most important feature for cancer detection
- Size-related features (worst perimeter, worst radius) are highly significant
- Multiple feature types contribute to robust diagnosis
- Feature importance aligns with clinical knowledge about breast cancer indicators
- Top 5 features account for majority of predictive power

## 3. SVM Decision Boundary Comparison

![Figure3](images/Figure_3.png)

**Description:**  
- Dual-panel visualization comparing Linear vs RBF SVM decision boundaries
- Data projected to 2D using PCA for visualization purposes
- Color-coded regions show classification boundaries (red=malignant, blue=benign)
- Training data points overlaid on decision regions with actual labels

**Insights:**  
- Linear SVM creates straight decision boundaries in the projected space
- RBF SVM creates complex, non-linear decision boundaries
- Clear separation between malignant and benign cases in reduced space
- Some overlap regions explain occasional misclassifications
- Demonstrates SVM's ability to handle different types of decision boundaries

## 4. Effect of C Parameter on SVM Performance

![Figure4](images/Figure_4.png)

**Description:**  
- Line plot showing training and test accuracy across different C values (0.01 to 100)
- Logarithmic x-scale to capture wide range of regularization strengths
- Performance comparison between training and generalization
- Markers indicate specific C values tested

**Insights:**  
- Optimal C value found at 1.0 for this dataset
- Very small C (0.01-0.1) causes underfitting with lower accuracy
- Very large C (10-100) shows minimal overfitting
- Moderate regularization provides best bias-variance tradeoff
- Training and test accuracy converge well at optimal C

**Description:**  
- Three-panel comparison of confusion matrices for different SVM configurations
- Linear SVM, RBF SVM, and Tuned SVM (Grid Search) performance
- Raw counts displayed in each cell with color intensity indicating frequency
- Accuracy scores displayed in each subplot title

**Insights:**
